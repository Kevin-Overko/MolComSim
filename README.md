The project simulates the movement of transmitting and recieving Molecules, with the obstruction of noise molecules,
with or without collisions. It counts the amount of step1s it takes for the transmitter molecule to reach the recieving
molecule given the current environment envoked.

Our job as a team was to take this simulation and allow Noise Molecules to move either directional or randomly.
